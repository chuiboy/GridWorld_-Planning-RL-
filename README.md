# GridWorld (Planning and Reinforcement Learning)
Contains algorithms for planning: policy iteration and value iteration. Also contains reinforcement learning algorithms: Monte-Carlo learning, Sarsa(lambda) and Q-learning. Uses these methods in the context of the GridWorld problem where the agent's goal is to find the quickest path to reach the terminal state.

The *game.py* file contains the Grid World environment. The other files can be run to perform reinforcement learning or planning (depending on the file chosen).
