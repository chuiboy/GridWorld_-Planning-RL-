# GridWorld (Planning and Reinforcement Learning)
Contains policy iteration and value iteration (planning). Also contains Q-learning (RL). Uses these methods in the context of the GridWorld problem where the agent's goal is to take the quickest path to reach the terminal state.

The *game.py* file contains the Grid World environment. Run the *policyiteration.py* file to perform policy iteration on the Grid World. The same can also be done for the *qlearning.py* and *valueiteration.py* file.
